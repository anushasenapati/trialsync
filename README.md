# trialsync

Project overview (introduction):

TrialSync is a patient-centric clinical trial matchmaking platform that recommends eligible trials to patients via an easy-to-use interface. It simplifies the recruitment process for both researchers and participants by streamlining eligibility, engagement, and communication. Our goal is to democratize access to trials and accelerate clinical research outcomes.

Problem:

Over 80% of clinical trials are delayed or terminated due to insufficient patient recruitment. Patients often don’t know clinical trials exist, or they’re confused about whether they qualify. On the flip side, researchers struggle with high outreach costs and manual eligibility screening, leading to slow progress in medical research.

Solution:

TrialSync empowers patients to discover and swipe through personalized clinical trial matches, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Using a relevance score, only trials that fit a patient’s profile appear ranked by best fit. Researchers can upload, edit, and manage trial listings, and securely access anonymized patient matches to streamline communication and outreach.
